Table of a given number.
Don't forget to put \n(back slash n).
If you want use i>0, use do while loop.
Because do while execute the statement inside loop, atleast one time even before checking the condition.
In do..while don't forget to put semicolon at last.
In conditional part upto how much time you want to print the data, that quantity need to be used.
