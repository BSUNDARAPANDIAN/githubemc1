Program to implement the calculator.
Get three inputs.
Two for operands.
One for operator.
Put one if condition for denominator not equal to zero.

In conditional part use variable of the input.
In case lable use operator with single quotes.
In printf statements use backslash n(\n), don't forget.
If you use single percentile symbol inside double quotes,it checks for meaning.
If meaning is not there,it will not displayed.
If you use double percentile symbol,there is meaning,it will print one percentile symbol.
It doesn't thrown any error.
